                found himself transf ormed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He
                lay on his armour-like ba ck, and if he lifted his head a little
                he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by
                arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
                it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
                pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved
                a bout helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he
                thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                although a lit tle too small, lay peacefully between its four
                familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
                on the table - Samsa was a travell ing salesman - and above it
                there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
                illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilde d frame. It
                showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
                upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
                low er arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out
